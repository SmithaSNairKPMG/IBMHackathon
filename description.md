PROBLEM
As per WHO advisory, we need to practice Social distancing to flatten the curve and keep safe from COVID-19.  Each firm/institution needs to reassess, reengineer and reimagine their workplace. We can arrange work-desks at a distance to follow social distancing but what about the cafeteria's or public places where managing distancing is really difficult as we canâ€™t compromise employees time and productivity as well as their health and well being.
