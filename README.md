## Short description

### What's the problem?

As per WHO advisory, we need to practice Social distancing to flatten the curve and keep safe from COVID-19.  Each firm/institution needs to reassess, reengineer and reimagine their workplace. We can arrange work-desks at a distance to follow social distancing but what about the cafeteria's or public places where managing distancing is really difficult as we can’t compromise employees time and productivity as well as their health and well being.

### How can technology help?

Using web application, employees need to issue a token to get in the cafeteria. Check in using the web application once entering the cafeteria and check out while exiting. The application admin will keep a track of people in the cafeteria at a time, using check in and check out process and thereby limit the activity of issuing new tokens. Admin can define the maximum tokens that can be issued for a cafeteria based on its size and resource availability. Users can view the number of tokens available at a time and can issue accordingly over web application.


### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](CorpDineArchitecture.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
